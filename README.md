# Classifying Monosyllabic Audio Samples into Yoruba Phonemes: Neural Networks

You can run Audio_Classifier.ipynb on Google Colab!

To run locally:

1. Setup local Python notebook runtime environment, using Conda, Jupyter, or VS Code Python Notebook extension

2. For my local Windows machine, first install python requirements using:

**python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt**

3. Tip: It may be useful to make a new virtual environment for fresh dependency installation. This is using Python3.13 locally (important due to deprecation of audioop, and need for audioop-lts instead)

4. Open the notebook, and run cells! Don't steal my database key please (only kept for access to database)!
